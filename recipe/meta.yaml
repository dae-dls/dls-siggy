  summary: This is a Python library with API for high level unix signal handling.
  description: |
    The software development group needs a simple high level API to capture and report unix signals, such as control-C.
    This reduces development time to create and test a signal handling in command line and gui programs.
    This library provides a signal class with state and counting, as well as a global (module) instance of it.
